##-------calculate productivity----
#1. check if any individual fish lengths >= max length
```{r}
#will need to make any lengths >= max size < max size (because we're assuming lengths were slightly overestimated in the field), otherwise formula doesn't work

sey_herb_trait_dat%>%
    filter(Size>=MaxSizeTL)
#1 Chlorurus atrilunula = 38 - 38 (so equals max size, note had updated max size based on field surveys with many individuals > 30)
#one Acanthurus tennentii = 31 - 31 (so equals max size)
#one Ctenochaetus truncatus = 17 - 16 (so one cm > max size)

sey_herb_dat_for_prod<-
  sey_herb_trait_dat%>%
  mutate(Size = if_else(Size >= MaxSizeTL, (MaxSizeTL- 0.1),
                            as.numeric(Size)))

sey_herb_dat_for_prod

#check if worked:
sey_herb_dat_for_prod%>%
    filter(Size>=MaxSizeTL)
#YUP

```


#2. get Kmax - same for all
```{r}
#first check traits all good:
sey_herb_dat_for_prod2<-tidytrait(sey_herb_dat_for_prod, sey_trait_dat,  levels.dataset = TRUE, include.method = FALSE)

# Formula from Morais and Bellwood (2018) 
fmod <- formula(~ sstmean + MaxSizeTL + Diet + Position + Method) #(recommended to use otolith for all)

# Predicting Kmax, the standardised VBGF parameter (Recommendation: use 100s to 1000s iterations) 
datagr <- predKmax(sey_herb_dat_for_prod2, 
                   dataset = db, #default, and as suggested by help file for ?predKmax
                   fmod = fmod,
                   niter = 1000,  # so used 1000
                   return = 'pred')

datagr <- datagr$pred

```


##3. Cacluclate production over set time scale
```{r}

# Positioning your fish in their growth trajectory----
with(datagr, applyVBGF(Lmeas = Size,
                       t = 1, #number of days - defaults to 1 day. We will also use 1 day, as this matches turf productivity measurements (so both primary and secondary productivity calculated per day)
                       Lmax = MaxSizeTL,
                       Kmax = Kmax))

#returns table, so bind with datagr:----
datagr$Size_1 <- with(datagr, applyVBGF(Lmeas = Size,
                       t = 1,
                       Lmax = MaxSizeTL,
                       Kmax = Kmax))

# Estimating gross somatic growth (g) using length-weight relationships (a,b)----
datagr$Biomass_gained_1<-with(datagr, somaGain(a = a,
                      b = b,
                      t = 1,
                      Lmeas = Size,
                      Lmax = MaxSizeTL,
                      Kmax = Kmax))


datagr
#yup double-checked - this equals new size biomass - original size biomass, in grams* All good :)


##convert from biomass gained in g to kg/ha:
datagr<-
  datagr%>%
  mutate(Biomass_gained_1_kg_ha = Biomass_gained_1/Transect.area*10) # same as (Biomass_gained_1/1000)/(Area*10000):  convert g to kg (/1000) and m^2 to hectares (10000)
datagr

#note: ignored stochastic mortality, because when only looking at 1 day mortality is minimal, so does not affect results. Plus, now this is total potential productivity (which should be more relevant for this study/metrics)

```



#4. Sum by transect and transect + feeding group
```{r}

str(datagr)

##sum by transect only (total herbivore productivity)----
sey_herb_productivity_transect<-
  datagr%>%
  group_by(Island, Site, Transect)%>%
  summarize(herb_productivity_kg_ha_day = sum(Biomass_gained_1_kg_ha))%>%
  ungroup()
sey_herb_productivity_transect

##sum by transect and feeding group (herbivore biomass)----
#need to keep FG.fine even when 0 for transect
sey_herb_productivity_transect_fg<-
  datagr%>%
    select(Island, Site, Transect, FG.how, FG.what, Biomass_gained_1_kg_ha)%>%
    droplevels()%>%
  group_by_at(vars(-Biomass_gained_1_kg_ha)) %>%
  summarise(productivity_kg_ha_day = sum(Biomass_gained_1_kg_ha)) %>%
  ungroup %>%
  complete(nesting(Island, Site, Transect),
           nesting(FG.how, FG.what),
           fill = list(productivity_kg_ha_day = 0))
sey_herb_productivity_transect_fg


```


##now combine biomass and productivity data, save----
```{r}
sey_herb_biomass_transect
sey_herb_biomass_transect_fg
sey_herb_productivity_transect
sey_herb_productivity_transect_fg


##by transect----
sey_herb_bio_prod_transect<-left_join(sey_herb_biomass_transect, sey_herb_productivity_transect, 
                                      by = c("Island", "Site", "Transect"))
sey_herb_bio_prod_transect


##by transect and fg----
sey_herb_bio_prod_transect_fg<-left_join(sey_herb_biomass_transect_fg, sey_herb_productivity_transect_fg, 
                                      by = c("Island", "Site", "Transect", "FG.how", "FG.what"))
sey_herb_bio_prod_transect_fg


#write csv's----
#write.csv(sey_herb_bio_prod_transect, "../data/seychelles_herbivore_biomass_productivity_by_transect.csv")
#write.csv(sey_herb_bio_prod_transect_fg, "../data/seychelles_herbivore_biomass_productivity_by_transect_and_feeding_group.csv")
